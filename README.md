# 1. Description
This is a Kaggle project with prize, aiming for constructing an agentic RAG system that accurately addresses cross-language queries for legal provisions.

# 2. Significance of the Project
In jurisdictions with highly complex legal systems (such as Francophone and German-speaking regions), the value of this Agentic RAG system for in-house legal teams of multinational companies—especially startups—lies in the following aspects:

## 2.1. Breaking language barriers
Even experienced legal professionals rarely have full proficiency in all official languages of the countries where a company operates. This system enables headquarters legal teams to directly retrieve and understand original legal texts written in complex local European languages (such as German, French, Italian, etc.) while querying in other languages (e.g., English or Chinese).

## 2.2. Lowering entry barriers and costs
In highly regulated regions such as Europe, initial consultations with law firms are extremely expensive. An intelligent agent capable of precise retrieval can complete up to 80% of the preliminary legal research work.

## 2.3. Counteracting legal fragmentation
Legal differences across European jurisdictions (for example, the cantons of Switzerland) are substantial. The agent can link statutes and case law across regions and hierarchical levels, helping to prevent compliance gaps.

## 2.4. High-credibility citations
Unlike general-purpose large language models that may hallucinate, this system enforces outputs grounded in official sources—exactly the “evidence chain” required for corporate legal decision-making.
